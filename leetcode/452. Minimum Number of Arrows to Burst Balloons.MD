## 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons 用最少数量的箭引爆气球
### Description:
There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.



### Example:

Example:

    Input:
    [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]

    Output:
    2

    Explanation:
    One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

### 解答

这是一道贪心问题，我们每次戳破气球的时候都要尽可能的戳破更多的气球。

怎么样才能尽可能戳破更多的气球呢？

我们可以先按照气球的右坐标进行从小到大排序。从第二个气球开始，只要第二个气球的左坐标小于第一个气球的右坐标，那么在戳的时候就可以把这两个气球一起戳破。

具体代码如下

### 代码
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
     if (points.empty()) return 0;
     sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [&](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b){return a[1] < b[1];});
        auto lastPoint = points[0][1];
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i ++) {
         if (lastPoint >= points[i][0])
          continue;
         count ++;
         lastPoint = points[i][1];

        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
